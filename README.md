# BEIT-PROJECT_16_Web_Based_Student_Helpdesk_System
Project by Nilesh Yadav, Amol Beldar Beldar and Viraj Ghag.
As we see in our day to day college life we may notice students facing some kinds of problems
which they may not directly convey it to the teachers due to many reasons.Hence to over-
come this problems a `Web Based Student Helpdesk' is a great solution for this problem.In
this system we are trying to make a web application in which student and staff can interact
with high authority using this service.The system will be sea kind of a web application which
will be used by the college individuals to address there problems,complaints,suggestions or
request etc to the college administration.A web application is any computer-like device de-
ployed in a public venue to give people self service access to products and services.Using this
idea of web application technology we can similarly deploy such web application systems
in college corridors to get an easy access to the system and enable the individuals to write
down their problems ,complaints, suggestions or request etc to the college authorities with
complete confidentiality
