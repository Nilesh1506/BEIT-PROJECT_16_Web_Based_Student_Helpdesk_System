# Brief Description
  As we see in our day to day college life we may notice students facing some kinds of problems
which they may not directly convey it to the teachers due to many reasons.Hence to over-
come this problems a `Web Based Student Helpdesk' is a great solution for this problem.In
this system we are trying to make a web application in which student and staff can interact
with high authority using this service.The system will be sea kind of a web application which
will be used by the college individuals to address there problems,complaints,suggestions or
request etc to the college administration.A web application is any computer-like device de-
ployed in a public venue to give people self service access to products and services.Using this
idea of web application technology we can similarly deploy such web application systems
in college corridors to get an easy access to the system and enable the individuals to write
down their problems ,complaints, suggestions or request etc to the college authorities with
complete confidentiality.
  The purpose of this project is to provide the colleges with an interactive system for dier
ent activities going on in the colleges.The students will be able to know, ask complaint etc
about what all activities colleges is doing for the students. Also we can provide students
to give there suggestions or requests for particular activities that the students may require
on college/departmental or personal basis as well.We will be making a website for an online
complaint management system where the issues of the student can be registered online and
will be resolved by the college authorities.This web application can reduce the gap between
the student and the college staff as all the requests,complaints suggestions etc will be confidential and only the authorised person or the person who is intended to the requests can be able to view it.
  The main objective behind building this project is to reduce the communication gap be-
tween the students and the college authorities and also help in creating a techno friendly
environment and save time.With the use of the web application students can be able to
convey there problems without hesitating to the college officials.Students will also be able
to apply/request for some important college applications/credentials as well (eg. Bonafide
certificate,Concession forms etc).
